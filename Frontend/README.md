# CMS Frontend

Simple React (Vite) frontend for the CMS.

Setup (Ubuntu)

1. Install Node.js and npm (if not already installed)

2. Install dependencies and run dev server:

   npm install
   npm run dev

By default the frontend assumes the backend API is at http://localhost:5000/api. Change the URL by setting VITE_API_BASE in a `.env` at the project root.
